## General Information

## Project Information

> Deriving the Insights on the Loan Dataset of a Major Online Loan Marketplace using EDA.

## Project Background

> This company is a leading **online loan marketplace**, providing personal loans, business loans, and financing for medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access loans with lower interest rates through a user-friendly platform.

> A significant challenge is credit loss from lending to **'risky'** applicants, which occurs when borrowers default on their loans. Identifying these high-risk applicants is crucial to minimizing losses. 

> This project aims to use ** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ** to uncover the factors that contribute to loan defaults. Understanding these key indicators will help the company improve its risk assessment and manage its loan portfolio more effectively. Further research into risk analytics is recommended to enhance this understanding. 

## Business Problem Trying to Solve

> To determine the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default.

## Dataset that is being used

> Loan Data (.csv) file for all loans issued through the time period 2007 to 2011

- Borrowers with least grades like E,F,G which indicates high risk.
- Borrowers with the Income Source not verified are likely default.
